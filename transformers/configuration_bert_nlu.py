class BertNLUConfig(BertConfig):
    r"""
        :class:`~transformers.BertConfig` is the configuration class to store the configuration of a
        `BertModel`.


        Arguments:
            vocab_size_or_config_json_file: Vocabulary size of `inputs_ids` in `BertModel`.
            hidden_size: Size of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.
            num_hidden_layers: Number of hidden layers in the Transformer encoder.
            num_attention_heads: Number of attention heads for each attention layer in
                the Transformer encoder.
            intermediate_size: The size of the "intermediate" (i.e., feed-forward)
                layer in the Transformer encoder.
            hidden_act: The non-linear activation function (function or string) in the
                encoder and pooler. If string, "gelu", "relu", "swish" and "gelu_new" are supported.
            hidden_dropout_prob: The dropout probabilitiy for all fully connected
                layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.
            attention_probs_dropout_prob: The dropout ratio for the attention
                probabilities.
            max_position_embeddings: The maximum sequence length that this model might
                ever be used with. Typically set this to something large just in case
                (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
            type_vocab_size: The vocabulary size of the `token_type_ids` passed into
                `BertModel`.
            initializer_range: The sttdev of the truncated_normal_initializer for
                initializing all weight matrices.
            layer_norm_eps: The epsilon used by LayerNorm.
